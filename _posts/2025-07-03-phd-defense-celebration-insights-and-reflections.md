Introduction

## Why PhD 

### At the time
Deep dive into a topic of interest. eventually interested in translation but wanted to train fully to do basic research. Expertise, approch, ways of thinking. chance to go abroad widen my exposure.

### In retrospect
Beyond the techincal aspects of the project. philosophy of science. approach to reserach. my reflection - rethinking how we choose our questions. hot take- doesnt really make you industry / job market ready. mostly projects are individual driven, no tight timelines, few stakeholders and mostly with the same background and motivations. but it does provide a platform from which to make yourself so if you are lucky with the lab and location.

## Why Switzerland {.tabset}

### At the time
lab I wanted to work in happened to be there

### In retrospect
One of the best phd salaries. Active innovation ecosystem. great work life balance. good quality of life. beautiful country. but cultural and language barriers to surmount for success. particulary pivoting out of academia is challenging especially for "third country nationals" (non-eu).

## How did I get there {.tabset}

### At the time
contacted PI cold but 3 follow up emails. Was happy to support, great zoom chat. FBM fellowship. What helped: was working on microbiome and new dna sequencing tech that the lab was also expanding metagenomics and bioinformatics using NGS. Demonstrated interested in biotinformatics had not done a lot of it but familiar with R (ecology course work for a start), bash (enthusiatic friends who got me into linux), getting familiar with snakemake (curiosity and challneged myself to use it for masters thesis). This combined with wet lab work experience in previous project.

### In retrospect
right place right time. demonstrated interest in forward looking area not just what the lab was working on at the time. Good profile for international FBM fellowship and interview went well. funding environment good. More challengning now even in switzerland.

## Celebrating the defense

inspiration for a multi-cultural celebrations? - Apero with bread and cheese followed by south indian snacks (sundal, idly, podis), german mini sausages and cakes for dessert.
