I made an Airtable Interface to track my personal finances, integrating AI tools to streamline the data entry process. Helps get an idea of expenses and plan budgets better.

I created a dummy version with the [interface](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invrGdYmKkL0UNhVl&inviteToken=097a88069bb5d5857b2018df58499364ae9ef93db06fe0ed9360c566e524efc2&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts) on this [Airtable](https://airtable.com/appK6jp0iyKISZw2J/tblDXPPgkIEhhv9MN/viw4LYZflX1ppEThz?blocks=hide) that can be used as a template. It works by accepting a csv table containing transactions (amount, description, date) being the relevant fields. Then using the views that make it convenient, it lets me categorize the payments.

I find the calendar view especially helpful for keeping an eye on how often I made certain purchases and maintain myself accountable.
