I’ve been learning Carnatic music since I was a child—with varying levels of dedication through my school years. Around 2018, while pursuing my undergraduate studies in Bangalore, I developed a deeper appreciation for the art and resumed formal training. Since then, I’ve enjoyed listening, practicing, and performing at local events and contests.

Here are a few recordings from the past few years. Many of these would not have been possible without the collaboration and encouragement of several talented friends. I’ll be adding more details about each song and artist soon.
