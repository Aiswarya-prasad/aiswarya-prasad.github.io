I have been learning to sing carnatic music since I was a kid with varying levels of dedication over my school years. Motivated by a newfound appreciation for the art around 2018 as an undergrad student in Bangalore, I renewed classes and have been enjoying listening, singing and taking the opportunity to perform at local events and contests. Here are a few videos of me singing at some events over the past few years. Several of these would not have been possible without the collaboration and support of several talented friends. I will add more information about each video including the songs and artists soon.
