I never thought Iâ€™d have the patience for something as intricate as crochet â€” now here I am, completely hooked.
Itâ€™s the perfect mix of creativity (colors, patterns, endless possibilities), challenge (learning new stitches, reading patterns, building speed), and relaxation (counting stitches, working row by row).

Below are some of my first projects:

### ðŸ‘œ Granny Square Pouch  
I loved this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Granny-Square-Sourcebook-Contemporary/dp/9491643290), for its explanation of the basics as well as the pretty patterns. I made the *Spring Square* pattern which I found beginner-friendly and fun for all the color variation.

Through this project I realized that granny squares are a great way to start crocheting! They are a great way to practice different stitches while still making something pretty. Most granny square projects out there are big like blankets or cardigans which involve making 20+ squares. I wanted something small and quick but more useful than coasters (which are too pretty to get dirty). So I made two granny squared and single crocheted them into a pouch and added a drawstring.

### ðŸ§£ Simple Winter Scarf *(WIP)*
Made with ombrÃ© yarn for a soft gradient effect. Learned from this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQvufVGCoQ).
<!-- and [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G2YLfyQGvs) for the scalloped edging. -->
It was a great way to practice plenty of single and double crochets and get comfortable with the hook.

### ðŸŽ§ AirPods Case  
Since I kept mixing mine up with my husbandâ€™s, I made a distinct one for myself.  
Another [YouTube-inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBu7wfX-mek) project.

### ðŸ‘¶ Baby Gifts

This is probably my most special project so far. I made these for a baby in our family, and it was such a joy to create something for a little one and the parents loved it!

**Pretty Pink Baby Shoe** â€“ WIP and completed pics. Learned from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVy27Z3kotk&list=PLOw6B1kb87p_035ZkVpfihDPda4dyxXm2) and made the bow as shown on this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMw9zpmXHHI&list=PLOw6B1kb87p_035ZkVpfihDPda4dyxXm2&index=2).
