I never thought Iâ€™d have the patience for something as intricate as crochet â€” now here I am, completely hooked.
Itâ€™s the perfect mix of creativity (colors, patterns, endless possibilities), challenge (learning new stitches, reading patterns, building speed), and relaxation (counting stitches, working row by row).

Below are some of my first projects:

### ðŸ‘¶ Baby Gifts

This is definitely my most special project so far. I made these for a baby in my family, and it was such a joy to create something for a little one and her parents loved it!

**Pretty Pink Baby Shoe** â€“ WIP and completed pics. Learned from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVy27Z3kotk&list=PLOw6B1kb87p_035ZkVpfihDPda4dyxXm2) and made the bow as shown on this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMw9zpmXHHI&list=PLOw6B1kb87p_035ZkVpfihDPda4dyxXm2&index=2).

**Sunflower Baby Shoe** â€“ WIP and completed pics. Learned from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLNGz9uM_2Y&list=PLOw6B1kb87p_035ZkVpfihDPda4dyxXm2&index=7) but used brighter summer colors.

### ðŸŽ§ AirPods Case  
A pretty, practical solution to constantly picking up my husband's airpods instead of mine. Another [YouTube-inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBu7wfX-mek) project.

### ðŸ‘œ Granny Square Pouch
I loved this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Granny-Square-Sourcebook-Contemporary/dp/9491643290), for its explanation of the basics as well as the pretty patterns. I made the *Spring Square* pattern which I found beginner-friendly and fun for all the color variation.

Through this project I realized that granny squares are a great way to start crocheting! They are a great way to practice different stitches while still making something pretty. Most granny square projects out there are big like blankets or cardigans which involve making 20+ squares. I wanted something small and quick but more useful than coasters (which are too pretty to get dirty). So I made two granny squared and single crocheted them into a pouch and added a drawstring.

### ðŸ§£ Simple Winter Scarf *(WIP)*
Made with ombrÃ© yarn for a soft gradient effect. Learned from this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQvufVGCoQ).
<!-- and [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G2YLfyQGvs) for the scalloped edging. -->
It was a great way to practice plenty of single and double crochets and get comfortable with the hook. It did take a very long time to finish as a beginner. I went length-wise and only managed 1.5 to 2 rows in one sitting. At least it is ready for winter the next year!
