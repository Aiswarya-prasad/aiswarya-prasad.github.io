> As I was drafting the Introduction of my PhD thesis, starting with how little was known about bacteria for centuries following Anton van Leeuwenhoek’s first glimpse of "animalcules" under a microscope, I found myself reflecting on how far we’ve come and how fast. Today, we have discovered and characterized tens of thousands of kinds of bacteria. We can even precisely edit their genomes as we like. There is a long and growing list of things we would like bacteria to do, from producing medicines to solving environmental challenges. I've found fundamental research fulfilling, but am equally drawn to the challenge and need for of turning that knowledge into practical, innovative solutions. I'm eager to bridge the gap between fundamental research and bringing innovation in biotech and healthcare to the community at large. Alongside my academic work, I've developed a growing interest in the business side of science. I am looking forward to opportunities in the intersection of science and business, where I can use my scientific background to inform strategic decision-making, support impactful innovation and help sustainably bring transformative technologies to those who benefit from them.

## Ongoing Engagements

### PhD Candidate

I am working on writing up my PhD thesis on gut microbiome ecology and evolution. A talk presenting my most recent work is featured [below](#Featured). More details about my research can be found on my [Research page](/research).

### Nucleate Leadership

[Nucleate](https://nucleate.org/) is a trainee-led non-profit organization that facilitates the formation of pioneering biotech companies, fosters a global ecosystem of bio-entrepreneurs and democratizes biotech education. I have been directing strategy and expert sourcing as part of the [Nucleate Switzerland](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nucleate-switzerland/) leadership team.

### Consulting Society

As a senior member and consultant at [The Consulting Society](https://www.theconsultingsociety.com/) (TCS, EPFL), I am working with a team of consultants on developing AI/ML use cases for a client in partnership with Oracle. I also lead junior members through semester-long projects. Here is the [slide deck](/files/AP-TCS-Presentation.pdf) from my junior project where I did a deep dive into large-scale measures to reduce GHG emissions from Agriculture.


<!-- > **About Me**: I am a scientist with expertise in bioinformatics and microbial ecology, with a keen interest in understanding the complex interactions between bacteria and their environments. My scientific interests are driven by my excitement about cutting-edge approaches like high-throughput genome-resolved metagenomics, long-read sequencing, and strain-level analysis and manipulation to gain unprecedented insights into microbial communities and engineering them. I thrive in multidisciplinary environments, where I can benefit from and contribute to diverse perspectives and expertise.

> **Vision**: Looking to the future, I am eager to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical, innovative solutions. While fundamental research is deeply fulfilling and fosters intellectual growth, there is an increasing demand to translate these insights into solutions that can benefit the broader community that funds it. Tackling core challenges, particularly in emerging fields, requires a deep, nuanced understanding of technologies. However, translating insights from fundamental research into actionable solutions demands skills like strategic planning and implementation— often underemphasized in academia. By combining my training in fundamental research with these essential skills, I aim to drive innovation in biotech and healthcare. -->

<!-- # My Background
> Where I would like to go: 5 years from now I would like be able to say, "You know of that microbiome product which is now the only viable cure for a pressing women's health issue?" or "the most clean and sustainable solution to pest control?", I made that happen!

As an undergraduate in Bangalore, India, I was captivated by the idea of bacteria as engineerable machines that can be harnessed to solve global problems. This interest motivated me to co-found the first iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) team at our institute. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, involving countless hours of brainstorming and designing our genetically engineered system. We successfully secured funding and lab space, ultimately presenting our work at the iGEM competition in Boston. This effort laid the groundwork for future teams, who have since won gold medals and received special nominations.

My academic journey has continued to focus on bacteria in communities and their interactions within different environments, such as the human gut. For my MS thesis, I explored the human gut microbiome, establishing a cost-effective Nanopore sequencing system that facilitated collaboration with local doctors in India.

Building on my interest in studying bacterial communities, I started my PhD in Lausanne. I study gut microbiome diversity and its evolution. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sampling, bioinformatics, and synthetic microbial communities in our honeybee laboratory model. I am particularly excited about cutting-edge sequencing and bacterial community engineering techniques and have successfully integrated Metagenomics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing in my research. -->
