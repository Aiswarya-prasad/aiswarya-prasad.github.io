## Bridging Science and Impact

I found myself reflecting on how far microbiology has come since "Anton van Leeuwenhoek’s first glimpse of the microbial world" as I was drafting the introduction to my PhD thesis. For centuries, bacteria remained largely mysterious. Today, we can engineer microbes and molecules with remarkable precision. This rapid progress in our understanding of biology has enabled applications ranging from developing new medicines and treatments, to generating food from waste products.

I belive that now more than ever, the world needs scientific experts and creative thinkers who can bridge deep technical insight with strategy and execution. I am particularly motivated to pursue roles that connect life sciences with strategy, helping innovation move from experiments in the lab to products and services that people can benefit from.

## Recent Roles & Initiatives

### 🧬 Nucleate — Assistant Manager, Activator Operations  
I volunteer as part of the HQ team at [Nucleate](https://nucleate.org/), a global non-profit that supports academic founders building biotech ventures. I help coordinate strategy and infrastructure for the operation of Nucleate's flagship Activator program across 18 global chapters.

### 🎓 PhD in Quantitative Biology  
Recently completed a PhD on gut microbiome ecology and evolution at the University of Lausanne. My research combined field sampling with comparative metagenomics, and synthetic microbial communities. Or more simply put, I studied how gut bacterial strains evolve and interact in gut microbiomes.

Scientific Talk [featured below](#Featured) • More on my [research](/research)

### 🔍 Consulting Society, EPFL  
Led a student consulting team advising a bacterial diagnostics startup. Mentored three new members on junior projects, two of them were subsequently staffed on client-facing projects.

[Recommendation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiswarya--prasad/#:~:text=Recommendations,Recommendations) received from client upon project completion.
