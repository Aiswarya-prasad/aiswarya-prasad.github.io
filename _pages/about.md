## Bridging Science and Impact

While drafting the introduction to my PhD thesis, I found myself reflecting on how far microbiology has come since Anton van Leeuwenhoek’s first glimpse of the microbial world. For centuries, bacteria remained largely mysterious. Today, we’ve identified tens of thousands of species and can engineer them with remarkable precision.

This rapid progress has enabled applications across sectors: developing new medicines, breaking down plastic waste, fixing nitrogen for agriculture, and generating food from greenhouse gases. It's a powerful reminder of how fundamental science can translate into real-world solutions.

I belive now is the time of need for scientifically trained thinkers to connect deep technical insight with strategy and execution. I’m particularly seeking roles that bridge life science and strategy, and helping innovation move from the lab into the world.

## Recent Roles & Initiatives

### 🧬 Nucleate — Assistant Manager, Activator Operations  
I volunteer as part of the HQ team at [Nucleate](https://nucleate.org/), a global non-profit that supports academic founders building biotech ventures. I help coordinate strategy and infrastructure for the operation of Nucleate's flagship Activator program across 18 global chapters.

### 🎓 PhD in Quantitative Biology  
Recently completed a PhD on gut microbiome ecology and evolution at the University of Lausanne. My research combined field sampling with comparative metagenomics, and synthetic microbial communities. Or more simply put, I studied how gut bacterial strains evolve and interact in gut microbiomes.

Scientific Talk [featured below](#Featured) • More on my [research](/research)

### 🔍 Consulting Society, EPFL  
Led a student consulting team advising a bacterial diagnostics startup. Mentored three new members on junior projects, two of them were subsequently staffed on client-facing projects.
