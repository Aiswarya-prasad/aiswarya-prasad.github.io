Education
======

**PhD in Quantitative Biology**
_University of Lausanne, Switzerland | AUG 2020 - AUG 2025 (planned)_
Thesis title: “Ecology and evolution of the gut microbiome in honeybees”
 + Awarded the Faculty of Biology and Medicine (FBM) PhD Fellowship and Mathilde Agassiz Scholarship (awarded to top-placed FBM fellow).
 + Presented research as posters at 3 prominent international conferences; invited as a speaker at 2. Co-authored 4 publications and performed the peer-review of 2 papers.
 + 4 years of Teaching experience as TA for the Master-level “bioinformatics through research” course; developed an R markdown template to improve and standardize course material as interactive HTML documents. Supervised semester-long student projects presented at the course.
 + Engaged as a student representative on the department Faculty Hiring Committee and the organizing committee for the annual department scientific retreat.

**B.S. and M.S. in Biology**
_Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | AUG 2015 - JUL 2020_
Masters thesis: “Analysis of the human gut microbiome by Nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing” (Grade: 8/8)
 + KVPY National Science Fellowship (All-India rank: 335)


Research experience
======

**PhD candidate**
_University of Lausanne | AUG 2020 - PRESENT_
+ Led honeybee gut microbiome evolution research using next-generation sequencing and custom-made [Snakemake pipelines](https://github.com/Aiswarya-prasad/honeybee-cross-species-metagenomics/).
+ Designed and conducted experiments on microbiota-free bees with synthetic bacterial communities to study processes influencing community assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing.
+ Collaborated with multi-disciplinary teams in Malaysia and Kenya and initiated a new collaboration in India, expanding the study’s scope with cross-country data and mitigating delays due to pandemic restrictions in Malaysia by over one year.


**Master thesis research**
_Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | MAY 2019 - MAY 2020_
+ Established Nanopore sequencing system in a low-resource setting at 10% of the cost of other commonly available systems.
+ Developed an end-to-end pipeline from sample collection to bioinformatic analysis for metagenomics; tested various approaches for sample preparation and metaproteomic analysis of fecal samples using LC-MS/MS.
+ Analyzed the human gut microbiome in chronic pancreatitis patients, studying disease-related changes in collaboration with doctors. 


**iGEM undergraduate research**
_Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | MAY 2016 - OCT 2016_
+ Co-founded the first team from the institute and secured a bronze medal at iGEM in Boston, a competition for innovative biotech solutions using genetically engineered machines.
+ Contributed to the designing and cloning of a quorum sensing-based auto-inducible system for protein overexpression in bacteria.
+ Engaged in teamwork to secure funding for research and travel via three grants.
