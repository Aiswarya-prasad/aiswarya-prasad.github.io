Participated in a workshop exploring challenges and opportunities in Northâ€“South research collaboration. Discussions focused on identifying barriers to equitable partnerships and co-developing strategies to address them. I contributed to sessions on power dynamics, knowledge production, and capacity building in global research networks.
