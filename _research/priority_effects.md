Gut microbial communities often differ at the strain level even among closely related individuals, but the ecological mechanisms driving this variation are not well understood. One potential driver is **priority effects**—differences in the timing or order of microbial colonization—which can lead to lasting differences in community structure even under similar environmental conditions.

In this project, we test the role of priority effects in shaping gut microbiota using honeybees as an *in vivo* model. Honeybees host a simple, well-characterized gut microbiome, and their colonies offer a tractable system for studying strain-level dynamics under controlled conditions.

We sequentially colonized microbiota-depleted honeybees with two synthetic communities composed of the **same 12 bacterial species**, but with **different strain variants**. Across replicates, we observed that **firstcomer strains consistently dominated**, though the strength of this effect varied by strain and species. Removing select strains from the first wave only partially restored the ability of latecomer conspecifics to establish—suggesting that **priority effects also occur across species boundaries**.

These results highlight the importance of colonization order in shaping microbial communities at the strain level and offer insights into the stability and variability of host-associated microbiota.

### Context

- Understanding **strain-level assembly rules** is essential for predicting and designing microbiomes
- Most studies have not probed microbe-microbe interactions within species  
- Honeybees allow high-resolution, reproducible studies in a **natural but tractable** host system  

---

### Experimental Design & Technical Challenges

- Designed a **controlled colonization experiment** using synthetic communities of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* strains  
- Developed a **high-throughput compatible PacBio metagenomic approach** to sensitively detect and quantify individual strains in vivo  
- Implemented multiple combinations and replicates to evaluate robustness and generality of observed priority effects  

---

### Findings & Implications

- Pilot results show **species-level coexistence** through niche partitioning, consistent with previous work in honeybees  
- At the **strain level**, strong priority effects were observed—**early-arriving strains dominated over conspecifics introduced later**  
- Unique strain of Lactobacillus showed **weak priority effects**, making it an interesting candidate for development of robust probiotics
- Interactions within and between close **Bifidobacterium** species shape priority effects but not between genera, emphasising the importance **niche partitioning**

<!-- Through this study we aim to understand how bacterial strains in the gut microbiome interact with each other. Gut microbial communities often differ at the strain level even among closely related individuals, but the ecological mechanisms driving this variation remain poorly understood. One potential driver is priority effects, differences in the timing and order of microbial colonization, which can lead to the assembly of distinct communities, even under similar environmental conditions. Priority effects may specifically play an important role in shaping microbial communities at the strain level, given that strains of the same species typically occupy similar ecological niches. To test this, we examined gut microbiota assembly in honeybees, in which age-matched nestmates are known to host similar microbial communities at the species level but vary in strain composition. We sequentially colonized microbiota-depleted honeybees with two distinct microbial communities, each composed of the same twelve species but different strains. We found that firstcomer strains consistently dominated the resulting communities, though the strength of these priority effects varied among closely related strains and species. Dropping out individual strains from the firstcomer community only partially improved the colonization success of latecomer conspecifics, suggesting that priority effects also act across species boundaries. Our results underscore the importance of priority effects for gut microbial community assembly at the strain level and in shaping the specialized gut microbiota of bees.

**Context**: 
  * Understanding the factors influencing and maintaining strain-level community composition in microbiomes is crucial for predicting and manipulating microbial communities. 
  * Microbe-microbe interactions in the context of a microbial community at the strain-level are still understudied. 
  * Honeybees are a great model to study this _in vivo_ due to their simple gut microbiome and the experimental tractability of the host and microbiota.

**Challenge**:
    * Investigating priority effects in a community of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in the honeybee gut.
    * Developing a high-throughput compatible PacBio metagenomic approach to quantitatively detect strains in the gut.

**Expectations and Results**:

  * We expect that the priority effects will be seen at the strain-level and that species will coexist by niche partitioning as has been [shown](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68583) among in honeybee Lactobacillus species by a collegue.
  * We have developed a high-throughput compatible PacBio metagenomic approach to quantitatively detect strains in the gut.
  * A pilot experiment points to clear signs of co-existance of species but priority effects between strains of the same species.
  * I carried out more replicates and combinations of strains and am currently analyzing the data to confirm the observations from the pilot experiment. -->
