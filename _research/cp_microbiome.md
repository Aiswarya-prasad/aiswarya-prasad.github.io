As a Master's student eager to work on cutting-edge technologies, I chose to focus my thesis on gut microbiome research using **Nanopore sequencing**â€”an emerging platform that excited me deeply.

- My enthusiasm led me to **successfully convince my thesis supervisor to invest in a Nanopore sequencer**, which I then helped set up and optimize in the lab.
- I developed and refined **protocols for DNA extraction, sample preparation, and sequencing**, and implemented an **end-to-end metagenomic pipeline** using a newly configured Linux workstation.
- The project was a **collaboration with a nearby hospital**, where we collected and processed **fecal samples from chronic pancreatitis patients**.
- In collaboration with a gastroenterologist, we compared gut microbiome profiles from patients and healthy individuals to identify **disease-associated microbial changes**.

This project helped me develop both **wet-lab and computational skills** in microbiome research and laid the foundation for my future work in microbial ecology and bioinformatics.

<!-- * As a Master's student ready to begin my thesis I was motivated to continue working on a project that would utilize a cutting-edge technology to study the gut microbiome which I was very excited about.
* This excitement being contagious, I managed to convince my thesis supervisor to invest in a Nanopore sequencer for the lab.
* I used this opportunity to optimize protocls and setup the Nanopore sequencer in the lab and developed my bioinformatic skills starting with setting up a Linux workstation for the lab and implementing a bioinformatic pipeline for metagenomics analysis.
* I developed an end-to-end sampling and sequencing pipeline for metagenomics analysis of fecal samples using Nanopore sequencing in collaboration with a nearby hospital.
* In collaboration with a gastroenterologist we analyzed the human gut microbiome in chronic pancreatitis patients and compared them with healthy samples to identify disease-related changes in the gut microbiome.
