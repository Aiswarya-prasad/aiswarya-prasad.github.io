As an undergraduate student, I was excited to explore emerging technologies for studying the gut microbiome and joined a project focused on **gut metaproteomics**â€”the large-scale study of microbial proteins in the gut.

- I surveyed and tested multiple **sample preparation protocols** and **mass spectrometry workflows** for fecal samples using **LC-MS/MS**.
- I successfully detected microbial proteins, validating the feasibility of the approach.
- However, the study highlighted technical limitations, especially the **need for higher-resolution instruments** (e.g., nano-LC MS/MS) to improve detection sensitivity in complex fecal samples.

This early exposure furthered my long-term interest in **multi-omics approaches** for studying microbial communities.
