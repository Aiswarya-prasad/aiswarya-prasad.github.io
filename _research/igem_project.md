In 2016, I co-initiated the **first iGEM team** at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. The [iGEM competition](https://igem.org) (International Genetically Engineered Machines) is a global synthetic biology event that brings together student teams to design and build biological systems using standardized genetic parts.

Our project, **Cellfiefuge**, aimed to **reduce infrastructure demands in biomanufacturing** by engineering bacteria that could both **autoinduce protein expression** and **autoaggregate at the end of production**—eliminating the need for costly centrifugation during downstream processing.

### Highlights

- **Concept**: A synthetic biology solution to simplify protein production workflows—particularly relevant for low-resource or field-deployable applications
- **Outcome**: Pioneered iGEM participation at IISc and laid the groundwork for future teams, which have since gone on to earn awards and global recognition
- **Collaboration**: Partnered with student researchers, mentors, and sponsors to develop and present a full project at the iGEM Giant Jamboree in Boston

### Fundraising & Grants

As part of the founding team, I was involved in successful fundraising efforts, including:

- **iBEC Grant for Indian iGEM Teams (2016)**  
  ₹1,000,000 grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), India

- **India Alliance (Wellcome-DBT) Travel Grant (2016)**  
  ₹600,000 grant from India Alliance to support travel to the iGEM Giant Jamboree

- **Research Grant – Govt. of Karnataka (2016)**  
  ₹600,000 grant from the Department of IT, BT and S&T, Government of Karnataka, to fund research activities

This experience sparked my long-term interest in microbial engineering and exposed me early on to collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. It remains one of the most formative projects of my academic journey.

  <!-- * The iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition is an annual, worldwide synthetic biology event that brings together students from diverse backgrounds to design and build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts. In 2016, I co-initiated the first iGEM team at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India.
  * Our iGEM project aimed to cut infrastructure requirements for biomanufacturing initiatives by engineering bacteria that can autoinduce protein overexpression and autoaggregate when production is complete, replacing the need for centrifugation of large cultures.
